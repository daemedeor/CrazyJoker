Based off a game found [here], the purpose of the game is to win three, four, five contracts to win the "round". Offline the basic way to win a game is to use a standard 52 card deck, then fullfill the 'contract' that you choose.

For this game: seven cards are dealt, the rest of the cards are placed in the center, and then choose a card at random to place in the center. The next step is to either choose a contract and then play to win that contract. However, you can only choose a contract at most once. The first player to have the valid contract will the winner of that round. 

The Contracts
===================
  There are a total of six different contracts that someone can choose from, in no particular order:

    1. Full Full House: 
      The hand must consist of four cards of the same rank (no facecards) and three of the same face card.
    
    2. Fixed Straight: 
      The hand must consist of a Queen and six other cards, that are in order like a straight.

    3. The Big Flush:
      The hand must consist of seven cards all of the same suit.

    4. Faced by Evens:
      The hand must consist of four different face cards and three of the same cards that are even. For example: K, Q, J, A and three 2s or three 4s, 6s, etc.

    5. A Birthday Wish to You: 
      The hand must consist of your Birth date numbers! Here are the numbers:
        
        King = 0,
        Ace = 1,
        2-10 = Face Value,
        Jack = 11,
        Queen = 12

      One card for the month, two cards for the day and four cards for the year. For example if your birthday was 2/01/1990, the cards you would need is 2, King, Ace, Ace, 9, 9, King. Since there's no way to verify your actual birthday, we hope that you will be honest in the date you provide for the birthday, in order to fullfill this contract.

    6. Odd Man Out:
      
      This hand must consist of six odd numbers, four of those must be different card numbers and One King or Jack. For example 3,3,5,7,7,9,K.
